- developer's name, 
- a recent photo or avatar, 
- links to sections about them, 
- links to their work, 
- link to contact them

- clicking on a link scrolls to the correct section

- when I click on the link to the section about their work then the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications

- when I am presented with the developer's first application then that application's image should be larger in size than the others

- when I click on the images of the applications then I am taken to that deployed application
  
- when I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
then I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
